# Workstation Track — Handoff

You are picking up the Machina → agentic-development-workstation track. This file is the
cold-start: read it, then the three docs it points at, and you can start building without
asking questions.

## Where things stand (2026-07-06, Phase 2 steps 1–2 shipped)

The vision is locked and the design is verified. Phase 0 (seam audit + interface
contracts) shipped to main. The Phase 0 docs were then adversarially re-verified by an
11-agent workflow (4 verification lenses over 52 claims, 6 independent step designers, 1
completeness critic); every confirmed error was folded back into the docs, so what you
are reading is the corrected state (contracts now v1.1.1).

**Step 1 (workspace generalization) is SHIPPED** at `76d0699` — full gate green,
smoke-verified on the built app (coding repo boots with `capabilities: ['coding']`,
existing vault with `['knowledge']`).

**Step 2 (git substrate) is SHIPPED** at `3198ddd` — implemented by a 10-agent workflow
(4 sequential implementers, full-gate agent, 4-lens review: spec compliance, adversarial
git plumbing, test quality, Codex cold read; all 9 blocker/major findings fixed with
mutation-verified tests). Full gate green (`npm run check` 2909 tests, build,
`npm run test:e2e` 17 passed / 1 fixme-skipped). Smoke-verified on the built app via
Playwright probes: `git.status`/`diff`/`commitApproved` (both trailers in `git log`)/
`revertAgent` (restore + Machina-Reverts) on a real dirtied repo, non-repo structured
no-ops, and per-turn snapshot granularity (2 turns sent ⇒ exactly 2 pre-agent snapshot
commits). **Steps 3 (gate parity) and 4 (dock shell) are both SHIPPED** — see their
"What step N changed under you" sections below. **Steps 5 (snapshot retirement) and 6
(test-fixer template) are ALSO SHIPPED** (2026-07-06, parallel sessions; step 6 landed
first at `5f5c641`, step 5 rebased onto it and landed only after all of G1–G8 passed
on fresh evidence). The pre-run snapshot is RETIRED — the approvals gate owns CLI
rollback now; the gate checklist, parity ledger, and full P1/P2 transcripts live in
`03-snapshot-retirement-evidence.md`. **The Phase-1 tracer bullet PASSED with Casey
confirming on the running app (2026-07-06)** — see "Definition of done" below;
`HANDOFF-PARALLEL-STEPS-5-6.md` deleted per its own instructions. Phase 1 is COMPLETE.

**Phase 2 is underway. Steps 1, 2, and 3 are SHIPPED** — step 1 (adapter
registry + model aliasing + raw fallback) at `18cc29d` (contracts v1.2), step 2
(watcher health model) at `be07439` (contracts v1.2.1), plus a chat-output quality
pass at `fb7e17c` (thinking indicator, secret masking in thread output, honest tool
status), and step 3 (main-side harness↔thread binding + harness:run attribution
authority) at `4047d35` (contracts v1.2.2). All landed with the full gate (3345
tests at step 3, build, full e2e executed); step 3 additionally ran the built-app
tamper probe green (see its DONE block in 04-phase-2-specs.md).

**Next work order for the incoming team(s):**

- **Steps 4 and 7 are now the sanctioned parallel pair** (disjoint files; only
  append-only hotspot ends collide). Step 5 (per-agent revert UI) is UNBLOCKED —
  its hard gate was step 3's binding. Step 6 follows 2+3 (both landed) but collides
  with 7 on `harness-service.ts` listHarnesses — sequential vs 7. Step 8 follows 7
  (and consumes 1).
- **Blocked on Casey, do not land without the call**: OQ8 (workspace-switch PTY
  visibility graft — severable from step 6; step 6 lands green without it), OQ7
  (gallery roster — before step 8). Also pending Casey: the step-2 exit-bar dev-app
  observation (degraded banner + Retry while a simulated failure is driven), the
  step-3 harness-identity chip observation on a bound thread in the running app, the
  step-4 tick-counter acceptance, and dependabot triage (`npm audit --omit=dev`
  reports 1 moderate production vuln as of 2026-07-06).
- Untracked `.agents/skills/thought-engine-council/` at the repo root is Casey's —
  leave it alone, do not commit or delete it.

## The doc map (all in this folder — trust these over memory or older drafts)

1. **PLAN.md** — the vision: 13 locked decisions, five primitives, four phases,
   invariants. Do not re-litigate the decision table.
2. **00-seam-audit.md** — file:line evidence for every seam Phase 1 builds on, plus the
   two work orders (workspace generalization, gate parity). Has a corrections log.
3. **01-interface-contracts.md** — the typed contracts (v1.1). Section 4 is the
   load-bearing one: read its framing before touching anything agent-related.
4. **02-phase-1-specs.md** — six implementation specs in canonical order, one commit
   each. This is your work queue. Steps 1–4 are DONE (`76d0699`, `3198ddd`, `424b3cc`,
   step 3's landing commit); next are steps 5–6. Line numbers in the specs were
   verified at `7735644`/`ec6fa6d` and later steps have since moved code — re-verify
   with `rg` before editing.
5. **04-phase-2-specs.md** — the Phase 2 work queue (8 steps, canonical order; spec
   pass 2026-07-06 from a 4-designer + 2-judge workflow over four disk-verified
   investigation dossiers). Phase 1 is COMPLETE — new sessions start here. Pre-Phase-2
   hardening already landed: AGENTS.md regen unparked (`c7d463f`), symlinked-parent
   harness refusal + contracts v1.1.5 (`660dc56`). **Steps 1 (`18cc29d`), 2
   (`be07439`), and 3 (`4047d35`) are DONE — each step header carries a dated DONE
   block with its recorded deviations. Next = 4∥7 (parallel-safe pair); 5 and 6 are
   unblocked but sequential (6 collides with 7 on harness-service.ts).**

## What step 1 changed under you (`76d0699`)

1. **Root resolution now lives in `WorkspaceService`**
   (`src/main/services/workspace-service.ts`, singleton via `getWorkspaceService()`).
   `current()` returns `{ id, root, capabilities } | null`; `guard()` returns the one
   PathGuard. The old `filesystem.ts` exports (`setActiveVault`, `onVaultReady`,
   `activePathGuard`, `activeVaultRoot`) are GONE — step 2's git/approvals handlers
   resolve root from `getWorkspaceService().current()` main-side, exactly as contracts §6
   assumes; no `getActiveVaultRoot()` bridge is needed.
2. **`open()` order is load-bearing**: canonicalize → detect capabilities (BEFORE the
   TE_DIR scaffold; never key detection on TE_DIR contents) → PathGuard →
   `fileService.initVault` → set current → sequential-await ready callbacks.
   `vault:init` survives as a one-release alias that returns `ws.root`.
3. **`cli-thread:input` now requires `cwd`** (renderer sends `ctx.vaultPath` from
   `agent-transport.ts`). Step 2's per-turn `commitPreAgentSnapshot` goes inside
   `CliThreadSpawner.input()` which already receives that cwd — the spawner signature
   did not change.
4. **Config keys are `lastWorkspacePath` / `workspaceHistory`** with a `has()`-gated
   absent-only fallback to the legacy `lastVaultPath` / `vaultHistory`
   (`src/main/ipc/config.ts`, `LEGACY_KEY_FALLBACKS`). A stored null must never
   resurrect the legacy value; writes land on new keys only. Do not reintroduce the old
   key names anywhere — an exit-check `rg` in the specs enforces this.
5. **MCP tool counts moved**: the three `vault.*` tools are also registered under
   `workspace.*` aliases (invoked name flows into Spotlighting + gate prompts) — 12
   tools in the gated app server (`MCP_TOOL_COUNT`), 7 read-only in `mcp-cli`. Known
   accepted gap: `VaultQueryFacade`'s internal audit lines still say `vault.*`.

## What step 2 changed under you (`3198ddd`)

1. **`git-service.ts` replaced `vault-git.ts`** (git mv, history preserved; the
   snapshot trio is byte-identical). New exports: `headSha`, `status` (entries only —
   `isRepo` is composed at the IPC layer per §6), `diff`, `commitApproved`,
   `revertAgent`, `discard(root, paths, removeFile)` — discard REQUIRES the injected
   removeFile; the IPC layer binds `shell.trashItem`. All paths reach git as
   `:(literal)` pathspecs after a post-symlink containment check — pass plain relative
   paths, the service does the pinning.
2. **`getApprovalQueue()` in `src/main/ipc/git.ts`** is the lazy singleton step 3 wires
   the watcher/registry into — same instance the `approvals:*` handlers serve. The one
   AuditLogger lives at `userData/audit` (outside any watch root). Step 3's producer
   API: `recordWrites({ turnId, threadId, agentId, paths, flags?, description? })`
   (coalesces into `pc_<turnId>`, flags OR-merge, diff recomputed over the merged set)
   and `enqueueGateConfirm(opts, 30_000)` (the QueueHitlGate seam — auto-deny AND
   remove on timeout).
3. **Queue items are workspace-root-bound**: resolve in a different active workspace
   returns `workspace-changed`, item retained; failed approve/reject also retains the
   item. Checked before the stale-diff recompute.
4. **Machina-Reverts trailer value = the reverted shas** (not the agentId — see
   contracts v1.1.1 §8 for why); the agentId lives in the revert commit subject.
5. **Per-turn snapshot lives in `CliThreadSpawner.input()`** behind the
   `hasLiveSession` branch (the respawn path snapshots inside `spawn()` — exactly one
   snapshot per turn, ordering-tested). Step 5's retirement removes both call sites.

## What step 4 changed under you (`424b3cc`)

1. **Terminal strip state is per-thread and rides the thread file.**
   `dockState` is now `{ tabs, terminalStrip? }` (`src/shared/thread-types.ts`);
   legacy files decode `terminalStrip === undefined`. The strip store
   (`src/renderer/src/store/terminal-strip-store.ts`) must never import
   thread-store (thread-store imports it: seed in `loadThreads`, flush in
   `flushDockState`, drop in `deleteThread`). `seed()` is FIRST-WRITE-WINS —
   `loadThreads` re-runs mid-session (unarchive, vault re-open) and must not
   clobber live sessions. `drop()` kills the thread's bound PTYs.
2. **PTY lifetime across surfaces.** Migration = the existing
   `terminal:reconnect` seam (contracts §3): `stripToCanvas`/`canvasToStrip`
   (`terminal-migration.ts`) never kill; `canvas-store.removeNode(id,
   { preserveSession: true })` is the kill opt-out. The load-bearing tests
   assert kill is NEVER called on detach/migration — keep them honest.
3. **The close-before-bind race is handled by pendingKill parking.** Closing a
   strip tab whose webview has not yet reported `session-created` parks the
   session (store field `pendingKill`, runtime-only, never persisted); its
   webview stays mounted hidden IN THE SAME KEYED MAP POSITION (a remount
   would spawn a second PTY) until the id arrives and `resolvePendingKill`
   kills it. Known residual: spawn-then-instant-thread-switch (or thread
   delete) before bind still leaks one PTY — the reporting webview unmounts.
   Real fix is host-side sessionId pre-allocation (extend `terminal:create`
   to accept a caller-supplied id); left for a later step.
4. **TerminalDockAdapter** now takes `cwd` + `onSessionCreated`/`onSessionExited`
   (ipc-message protocol shared with TerminalCard) and always puts `cwd` in the
   webview URL — a stale persisted sessionId falls through reconnect and
   respawns there. URL construction lives in the pure builders in
   `terminal-webview-src.ts`; keep param names in sync with
   `TerminalApp.readUrlParams`.
5. **`fs:select-file`** landed per contracts §6 (guard-checked, null outside
   root, `guardSelectedFile` exported for tests). Appended at the END of
   `IpcChannels` and of the preload `fs` namespace (parallel-session
   append-only rule) — a later tidy-up may regroup it with the fs section.
6. **FilesDockAdapter vault switching is fixed** (step-1 review follow-up):
   `handleOpenVaultPicker`/`handleSelectVault` now dispatch the
   `te:open-vault` CustomEvent → `orchestrateLoad` → `workspace.open()`. The
   `onChangeVault` prop is accepted but unused.
7. **Known cosmetic/UX residuals** (from the step-4 review, deliberately not
   done): strip webview has no render-process-gone recovery; ctrl+backquote
   does not reach the host while a terminal webview has focus (webview
   isolation); a PTY that exits while its strip webview is unmounted respawns
   fresh on revisit; `thread-store.ts` sits at ~830 lines (was 825 — the 3
   sanctioned touches only). **Manual migration acceptance (tick-counter,
   Casey observing) is still open.**

## What step 6 changed under you (test-fixer harness)

1. **The harness surface is four new modules + one IPC file.**
   `src/shared/harness-types.ts` (slug regex, `HarnessScope`,
   `validateHarnessScope` superset check, Result-typed frontmatter parser,
   pure `buildHarnessPrompt`, re-exports `HARNESS_PROTECTED_GLOBS` from
   constants.ts where step 3 landed it), `src/shared/harness-templates.ts`
   (the one 'test-fixer' template; `<dir>` placeholders in allowedGlobs are
   materialized to `<TE_DIR>/agents/<slug>` at create time),
   `src/main/services/harness-service.ts` (create/list),
   `src/main/ipc/harness.ts` (root resolved main-side; null root ⇒
   `{ ok:false, error:'no-workspace' }` / `[]`), renderer
   `store/harness-store.ts` + `store/harness-run.ts`. Channels + preload
   `harness` namespace appended at file end per the standing rule.
2. **Create-order is load-bearing**: slug → template → scope validation
   (refuse-to-emit, BEFORE any write) → non-recursive `mkdir` (the
   no-overwrite check: EEXIST = structured error, never touch) → five
   entries → verify.sh LAST + chmod 0o555 → on any failure the partial dir
   is removed so the slot stays reusable. `harness:create`'s ok `root` is
   the created harness directory (absolute), not the workspace root.
3. **The frontmatter parser is deliberately not YAML.** It reads exactly the
   subset the generator emits (`key: value` + one `budgets` flow mapping,
   inline comments stripped). Hand-edited SKILL.md files it cannot read are
   skipped by `harness:list` (skip-not-throw), not errors.
4. **Thread.agentId is a persisted optional field** (`agent_id` in thread
   frontmatter, thread-md.ts): `createThread(agent, model, title, agentId?)`
   overlays + saves it, and `agent-transport.ts` re-sends it on EVERY
   cli-thread:spawn/input so harness attribution survives relaunch
   (spawn-on-demand path). Absent → spawner defaults to adapter identity —
   zero spawner/registry changes, exactly the step-3 seam.
5. **Palette wiring**: `buildPaletteItems` takes an optional `harnesses`
   snapshot; CommandPalette subscribes to harness-store and refreshes it on
   palette open. Create failures surface via `notifyError` (toast), success
   via `showToast`.
6. **harness-run waits for the fresh PTY's first prompt before the first
   turn** (`waitForNewShellPrompt`, block-store as the readiness signal,
   10s timeout then proceed-anyway). The scripted createThread→
   appendUserMessage path types the invocation into a shell that has not
   finished rc init; the te preexec hook isn't live yet, the block's
   command is mis-derived from the prompt echo, `detectAgentFromCommand`
   fails, and the reply is silently never mirrored. Humans never hit this
   (they type seconds after spawn). Write attribution is unaffected either
   way (PTY-alive window).
7. **Environmental find with daily-driver impact**: the INSTALLED
   `~/.te.zsh` on Casey's machine was a stale pre-`cmd=` version — its
   command-start marker carried no command, so block commands were derived
   from output echo at command-end, which included the prompt line and
   broke the bridge's agent detection (cli-thread replies lost). Fixed
   during the step-6 smoke by installing the current bundled hook (old file
   backed up at `~/.te.zsh.pre-step6-backup`). The bash/fish hooks were NOT
   checked — if cli replies misbehave under those shells, run the app's
   "Set up shell hooks" again.
8. **Smoke note for later steps**: Playwright probes drive the BUILT app, so
   TE_DIR is `.machina` there; `npm run dev` uses `.machina-dev`. The
   exit-bar transcript for step 6 (including the tray-approved
   `Machina-Agent: test-fixer` commit on a throwaway repo) is recorded in
   02-phase-1-specs.md step 6. The throwaway repo carried a repo-local
   `.claude/settings.json` allowlist (`npm test`/`sh`/`node`) so headless
   `claude --print` never blocked on an interactive permission prompt — in
   real use the user answers those in the dock terminal.

## What step 5 changed under you (snapshot retirement)

1. **`commitPreAgentSnapshot` is GONE.** Both call sites removed from
   `CliThreadSpawner` (spawn-site + the per-turn call in `input()`), and the
   function, `PreAgentCommitResult`, the `<TE_DIR>/no-auto-commit` opt-out, and
   `isAutoCommitOptedOut` are deleted from `git-service.ts`. `isGitRepo` and the
   whole §2 substrate are unchanged. `cwdByThread` was NOT orphaned (it still
   feeds `registry.turnStarted`) and stays. `rg 'commitPreAgentSnapshot' src
   tests` is zero — do not reintroduce it; rollback is the approvals gate
   (commitApproved trailers / discard / revertAgent).
2. **The retirement was evidence-gated, not assumed.** All of G1–G8 passed
   fresh at the landing HEAD — including G6 (hooks physically absent: writes
   still queue via the PTY-alive fallback with `flags.degradedAttribution`,
   proven on the built app with zero block events) — see
   `03-snapshot-retirement-evidence.md` for the checklist, the parity ledger
   (non-repo, gitignored, out-of-root, agent-runs-git), and the full P1/P2
   transcripts. The opt-out went with the snapshot because it only ever gated
   automatic commits and none remain (contracts §8 v1.1.4 — renumbered; step 6
   landed first and took v1.1.3).
3. **A probe-transcript gotcha for later steps**: the app scaffolds its own
   untracked `<TE_DIR>/` in any opened repo — a "porcelain clean" assertion
   after reject must except that scaffold (it is app state, not an agent
   write; the watcher excludes it too).
4. **Doc reconciliation**: overview.md CLI-agent paragraph, contracts §2/§4
   dated status lines, CLAUDE.md agents bullet, and safety-subsystem.md
   CLI-thread section all now describe the approvals-gate containment story
   (the latter two are gitignored — updated copies were synced to the
   canonical clone at landing). AGENTS.md regeneration remains PARKED
   (backlog: steps 1 + 5).

## What step 3 changed under you (gate parity)

1. **The attribution primitive is `getCliTurnRegistry()`**
   (`src/main/services/cli-turn-registry.ts`). Turn windows: open on spawner
   send, closed by the bridge's `onTurnComplete` (once per completed/cancelled
   block) via **open-invocation counting** — `turnEnded` only stamps when
   sends minus completions drains to 0, so a cancelled turn's late block
   cannot close the follow-up turn (over-counting leaves the window open:
   over-attribution, never silent escape). EVERY open window requires
   `isPtyAlive` (late-bound probe = `spawner.hasLiveSession`, set in
   `ipc/cli-thread.ts`); closed windows linger LINGER_MS regardless.
   `threadClosed` drops the window with zero linger — trailing ~400ms of fs
   events become audited unattributed writes (accepted trade, documented).
2. **headMoved is a two-point tripwire with an immutable baseline.**
   `headShaAtStart` never changes; queue-made approval commits are recorded
   per-turn (`noteQueueCommit`, wired in `ipc/git.ts`) and excused by the
   `git rev-list` walk in `isAgentHeadMove` (exported, pure). Detection at
   every attributed batch (audited once per turn) AND at turn close
   (`checkHeadMovedAtTurnEnd` in `ipc/git.ts` — catches a trailing
   self-commit that produces no watched fs event). An agent commit hiding
   BENEATH a later approval commit is still caught (walk-based, not
   tip-compare). A turn that commits and then writes can produce two audit
   entries (mid-turn + turn-end, disambiguated by `at:'turn-end'`) — by
   design, two independent detection points.
3. **`AgentWriteWatcher` re-binds via `initApprovalsForRoot(root)`**; its
   counterpart `stopApprovals()` is the FIRST await in `reconfigureForVault`
   (the active workspace flips before ready callbacks run — a stale watcher
   batch must never route against the new root; `autoReject` also takes the
   watcher's `expectedRoot` and refuses on mismatch). The watcher suppresses
   the queue's own discard echoes (`suppress(paths)`, 10s TTL, wired around
   the discard binding in `ipc/git.ts`) — without it, a Reject inside a
   still-open window resurrects the just-resolved item. `dist/build/out` are
   excluded at TOP LEVEL only; `.git`/`node_modules` at any depth.
4. **Approve commits AROUND gitignored-untracked paths**
   (`git-service.ignoredUntracked`: check-ignore `--stdin -z` minus
   index/HEAD membership) — `git add` exits 1 on any ignored pathname while
   still staging the rest, which would brick the item on every retry.
   All-ignored items degrade to acknowledge. Tracked-but-ignored files are
   NOT filtered.
5. **Known accepted residuals**: CLI PTYs from workspace A keep writing
   unwatched after a switch to B (contracts §4 scope limits — the tray footer
   states root-only scope; killing PTYs on switch is a product decision, not
   step 3's); self-write suppression outranks the forbidden-path check
   (inverting would auto-trash legitimate user edits to rules.md made through
   the editor; the ~2s same-path race is the contract's accepted timing
   race); `WriteRateLimiter` uses wall-clock internally while the watcher
   clock is injectable (prod-consistent; velocity tests use real timing).
6. **The step 6 seam is live**: `cli-thread:spawn`/`input` accept optional
   `agentId` (stored per thread, defaults to identity) — the harness slug
   flows into turn attribution and commit trailers with no further plumbing.

## What Phase 2 step 1 changed under you (`18cc29d`)

1. **The adapter registry is the single invocation authority.**
   `src/shared/agent-adapters.ts` (pure, renderer-importable): per-adapter
   `formatInvocation` absorbed the spawner's `formatCliInvocation` switch, optional
   `parseEvent` absorbed the bridge's claude/codex extractors
   (`supportsStructuredOutput` is now `!!adapter.parseEvent`), and `models` rosters are
   spike-verified. Session shapes live in `src/shared/session-types.ts` (contracts §3
   landed) — do NOT confuse with `cli-agent-session-types.ts`, which is CLI-agent
   *presence* types (the seam-map trap the spec warns about).
2. **The model-flag trust rule lives at the IPC boundary** (`resolveModelPick`,
   `src/main/ipc/cli-thread.ts`): a flag is emitted ONLY for an explicit user pick that
   passes membership in `adapter.models` plus a charset regex. Absent, unknown, or the
   persisted `DEFAULT_NATIVE_MODEL` filler ⇒ adapter default with no flag; rejected
   explicit picks are audited. The **golden byte-exact invocation tables** in the
   spawner tests are the regression harness — extend them when you touch invocation
   construction; never bypass them.
3. **`cli-raw` exists but is input-disabled** until step 8 lands harness-supplied
   invocation templates (OQ3): plain PTY, no parser, no resume, no models.
4. **`Thread.model` is real for CLI threads now** — `setThreadModel` is un-no-op'd and
   the model round-trips through thread-md encode/decode. Gemini's roster ships EMPTY
   (`models: []` — no auth on the dev machine to verify ids); widen it only with a
   real CLI spike, not from training data.

## What Phase 2 step 2 changed under you (`be07439`, contracts v1.2.1)

1. **The watcher has a five-state health machine** (starting/watching/degraded/down/
   stopped; `WatcherState`/`WatcherHealth` in `git-types.ts`) emitted via an optional
   `onHealthChange` dep and broadcast as `approvals:watcher-health`, with
   `approvals:watcher-status` (pull) and `approvals:watcher-retry` (manual restart,
   resets the backoff cap). All three silent death paths are hardened; `start()` races
   ready vs error vs a 30s timeout (injectable for tests) and THROWS on failure —
   vault init can no longer hang on a dead watcher.
2. **`restartWatcher` in `ipc/git.ts` is generation-guarded.** A module-level
   `watcherGeneration` counter bumps at `stopApprovals` / `initApprovalsForRoot` /
   `restartWatcher` entry; an in-flight restart that discovers the generation moved
   aborts with `watcher-restart-superseded` and retires its own just-built watcher.
   **Step 3 edits this file — respect the guard**: any new await-bearing path that
   rebuilds or rebinds the watcher must revalidate generation + root after each await,
   and stale watcher instances must not emit health. Same-root restarts NEVER call
   `getApprovalQueue().clear()` (mutation-tested); the clear stays in
   `initApprovalsForRoot` and is load-bearing for workspace switches.
3. **Turn tagging did NOT widen `TurnStartedOpts`** (recorded deviation): the registry
   takes a late-bound `setGateHealthProbe` (same pattern as `setPtyAliveProbe`), and
   `CliTurn.gateDegradedAtStart` flows into `PendingChangeFlags.gateDegraded` → queue
   merge → tray chip. The spawner was deliberately left untouched for step 3.
4. **Degraded UX**: tray warning dot (shows even at zero pending) + banner with the
   contract's honest copy + Retry; `WatcherHealthChip.tsx` holds the thread-header chip
   and the one-time inline notice (latch = inFlight∧unhealthy, a recorded superset of
   turn-start-unhealthy). ThreadPanel integration is three lines. Policy is OQ6:
   visibly degrade, NEVER block turns.
5. **`e2e/watcher-health.spec.ts` is the built-app probe and it has been executed
   green** (healthy boot → `watching`; chmod-000 subdir fixture → workspace live,
   state `down`). It encodes an e2e lesson — see the new repo gotcha below.

## What Phase 2 step 3 changed under you (`4047d35`, contracts v1.2.2)

1. **The attribution authority is `HarnessRunRegistry`**
   (`src/main/services/harness-run-registry.ts`, singleton via
   `getHarnessRunRegistry()`): write-once threadId→slug bindings persisted at
   `userData/harness-bindings.json` (key = workspaceRoot + NUL + threadId; a reserved
   budgets field is step 6's trust anchor). Bindings are minted ONLY inside
   `harness:run` (`harness-run.ts:composeHarnessRun`) after main's own validation:
   slug format + reserved-slug refusal (adapter identities like `cli-claude` can
   never be harness slugs — create/run/backfill all refuse), the v1.1.5
   realpath-equality re-check (residual #1 discharged), all four harness files
   readable, SAFE_ID threadId. Frontmatter `agent_id` is DISPLAY-ONLY now
   (thread-md.ts comments updated) — do not reintroduce it as an attribution source.
2. **Every forwarded agentId is validated at the IPC boundary**
   (`resolveRequestedAgentId` in `ipc/cli-thread.ts`, both spawn and input) with
   degrade-not-fail semantics: malformed / unbound-thread / binding-mismatch /
   registry-error ⇒ adapter identity + `cli-agent:attribution-mismatch` audit
   (decision `denied`, mismatches carry `boundSlug`) + `attributionSuspect`, flowing
   turnStarted → ActiveTurnMatch → PendingChangeFlags → tray chip. A degraded
   resolution also CLEARS any stale in-session slug in the spawner. The turn always
   proceeds — a throwing registry (e.g. one malformed file in the watcher-ignored
   threads dir; that DoS was a caught review blocker) degrades instead of rejecting,
   via the tolerant per-file thread scan (`listThreadAgentIdsTolerant`).
3. **Legacy threads got a one-time trust-on-upgrade backfill** per workspace root
   (persistent `backfilledRoots` marker; each minted binding audited
   `cli-agent:binding-backfill`). One-time is load-bearing: re-running per open
   would re-trust tampered frontmatter after every relaunch. After the epoch, ANY
   forwarded agentId on an unbound thread flags.
4. **The renderer run sequence changed** (`store/harness-run.ts`): createThread
   WITHOUT agentId → `harness:run { slug, threadId }` → on ok
   `setThreadAgentId(id, slug)` (the one sanctioned thread-store addition) → the
   unchanged shell-prompt wait → send main's prompt. Refusals AND thrown rejections
   delete the just-created thread (net "no thread created"). The send stays
   renderer-side — moving it into main re-opens the Phase-1 step-6 lost-reply
   failure.
5. **`HarnessIdentityChip`** on CLI thread headers shows the MAIN-sourced binding via
   the new `harness:binding` read channel; the thread's `agentId` prop is only the
   null→bound re-fetch trigger (the displayed value never comes from frontmatter).
6. **Known accepted residuals**: orphan bindings for deleted threads (revert
   validation is trailer-based, so harmless); a user-level agent can reach userData
   (same class as trailer forgery — accident containment, not a boundary); the
   selection-time PTY spawn does not forward agentId (input does, and input is where
   turns open — observed in the probe, attribution unaffected).
7. **Step 5 is unblocked**: `git:revert-agent` validation is trailer enumeration
   (unknown ⇒ `no-commits-for-agent`, test-pinned) — safe under a one-click UI.

## Chat-output quality pass (`fb7e17c`) — same landing window

Not a workstation step; touched only the thread/message rendering surface.
`ThinkingIndicator.tsx` (mounts via `InflightAssistant`'s `inFlight` prop),
`scanSecrets` masking over CLI output/tool pills/error cards via
`tool-renderers/mask-secrets.ts` (copy follows display; per-card reveal), honest tool
status (ok / failed / observed / pending / not run), `closeSession` synthesizes a
final message on PTY death (stale inFlight cleared), degraded-parse gate stops
truncated JSONL fabricating tool pills, non-AUTH native errors are system messages
now, and ThreadMessage keys are thread-scoped. **Known residuals for a later pass**
(recorded, not blocking): the interim-stream → final-markdown reflow "pop" in
`InflightAssistant`, and streamed-CLI finals dropping bridge metadata
(`use-thread-streaming.ts` finalize path rebuilds the message).

Repo gotchas the step-1 team hit (they will bite you too):

- **CLAUDE.md is gitignored in this repo.** `AGENTS.md` is the tracked copy: a
  byte-identical mirror of CLAUDE.md (only the `#` H1 title differs). After editing
  CLAUDE.md, sync it with `npm run sync:agents` — never hand-edit AGENTS.md, and do NOT
  use Codex for this. The mirror is a deterministic file copy, not a model task; a Codex
  round-trip wastes tokens and (observed at step 1) can delete unrelated files.
- **The e2e suite was stale-red on main before step 1** (6 of 18 failing at `bc86377`):
  it predated the titlebar Files toggle (the file tree lives in a right-edge side panel,
  closed by default — helpers `openFilesPanel`/`closeFilesPanel` in `e2e/app.spec.ts`
  handle it), the FirstRunScreen (no-workspace boot shows an Open Folder CTA, not an
  empty shell), and the settings-modal redesign (flat rows, no "Environment" page).
  Step 1 repaired those. The window-drag test is `test.fixme` against the known-open
  titlebar drag-region product issue — un-fixme it only when that is fixed.
- **e2e runs dirty `e2e/fixtures/test-vault/.machina/state.json`** (the app persists
  state into the fixture). `git restore` it before committing.
- **`page.evaluate` dies across the boot-time `location.reload()`** in e2e probes
  ("Execution context was destroyed"). Locator waits span navigations; evaluate does
  not. Pattern: after seeding the workspace and reloading, wait on an app-mounted
  locator (e.g. the approvals tray button) BEFORE any evaluate-based polling, and wrap
  polled evaluates in try/catch returning a retry sentinel. `watcher-health.spec.ts`
  is the working template — the step-2 gate hit this live.
- **Non-packaged runs (e2e, dev, Playwright probes) share
  `~/Library/Application Support/Electron/`** for electron-store + localStorage. Test
  pollution persists across runs; move the dir aside if you need a clean boot.
- Electron visual verification stays with Casey, but scripted Playwright probes against
  `out/main/index.js` (launch, seed config, reload, assert) are the sanctioned
  Claude-driven smoke path — step 1's probes are a working template.

## The five things that will bite you if you skip the docs

1. **The gate is post-persistence containment, not prevention.** CLI-agent writes are
   live on disk before anyone reviews them. Approve blesses into history; Reject reverts
   via git. UI copy and your own mental model must never claim writes are blocked. The
   agent is a full shell — it can run git itself; we detect (headMoved tripwire), we do
   not prevent. Adapter-native permission hooks were DEFERRED out of Phase 2 (OQ1,
   recorded in 04-phase-2-specs.md) — containment stays post-persistence all phase; a
   reserved `AgentAdapter` capability field keeps the future seam cheap.
2. **Never let rollback coverage gap.** DISCHARGED 2026-07-06: step 5's G1–G8 evidence
   gate passed on fresh runs (G6 included) and the snapshot was retired in the same
   step — coverage never gapped. The rule's spirit survives: rollback is now the
   approvals gate exclusively; do not weaken it without an equivalent evidence gate.
3. **The AgentWriteWatcher must NOT reuse vault-watcher's ignore patterns.** Those
   ignore TE_DIR and all dotpaths, which would blind the verify.sh auto-reject and every
   `.env` write. Contracts §4 v1.1 specifies its own ignore policy.
4. **Use the TE_DIR constant, never a literal `.machina`** (dev runtime is
   `.machina-dev`). The single exception is `HARNESS_PROTECTED_GLOBS`, which
   deliberately carries both variants.
5. **Verify disk before editing.** Line numbers in the specs were verified at
   `7735644`/`ec6fa6d` but steps move each other's code; `rg` first. This repo has also
   used git skip-worktree bits that silently ignore Writes (`git ls-files -v`).

## House rules that apply to every step

- Commit directly to main, one step per commit, no feature branches. Full pre-commit
  gate: `npm run check` + `npm run build`, fresh runs, evidence not transcription.
- Every deliberate deviation from the contracts amends `01-interface-contracts.md` in
  the same commit. CLAUDE.md changes propagate to AGENTS.md via `npm run sync:agents` (a
  deterministic mirror, not a Codex call) — never hand-edit AGENTS.md.
- Dev-app/DevTools smoke checks are driven by the agent, not handed to Casey as steps.
  Electron visual verification is Casey observing the running app — no programmatic
  Electron screenshots. The step 4 dock↔canvas migration acceptance (tick-counter
  continuity) explicitly needs Casey watching.
- Surgical scope: every changed line traces to the step's spec. Files under 800 lines
  (thread-store.ts is already at 825 — do not grow it; the specs route around it).

## Definition of done for Phase 1 — **MET (2026-07-06, Casey-confirmed)**

The tracer bullet, on a real repo, in one sitting: open repo → spawn terminal → create
test-fixer harness → run it → watch the turn in the tray → approve the diff → see the
`Machina-Agent: test-fixer` trailer commit → `revertAgent` cleanly undoes it. All
invariants in PLAN.md hold at every step boundary.

**Tracer-bullet run record**: Casey ran the full path manually on the running dev app
(2026-07-06), on a real repo with a deliberately broken test: palette create (six
entries, verify.sh 0555, duplicate-create refused), palette run (cli-claude thread
fixed the failing test), tray approve, `Machina-Agent: test-fixer` +
`Machina-Session` trailers on the approved commit, then
`window.api.git.revertAgent('test-fixer')` from the DevTools console returned
`ok: true` and produced a `Machina-Reverts` commit restoring the pre-agent tree.
All checks reported good. (revertAgent still has no UI affordance — console/IPC only;
candidate Phase-2 surface.) This confirmation followed the earlier automated
transcripts (step-6 smoke 11/11; step-5 P1/P2 in `03-snapshot-retirement-evidence.md`).

## Machinery you inherit (verified working, don't rebuild)

PTY core with ring-buffer reconnect (`terminal:reconnect` already exists — migration is
a renderer affordance), block protocol (OSC hooks → BlockDetector → BlockWatcher),
safety trio (`hitl-gate.ts` / `audit-logger.ts` / `path-guard.ts`), typed-IPC 4-step
pattern, `ShellService.create` already takes per-session cwd, `ThreadStorage` already
takes its root. (The pre-run snapshot listed here historically was retired by step 5 —
rollback is the approvals gate.) The full reuse map
with import-graph evidence is in 00-seam-audit.md §1.

## Known follow-ups from the step 1 review (dual review: Claude adversarial + Codex cold-read)

- **FilesDockAdapter vault switching bypasses `workspace.open()`** (pre-existing, NOT
  introduced by step 1): `handleOpenVaultPicker` / `handleSelectVault`
  (`FilesDockAdapter.tsx` ~305–330) call `vault.watchStop()/watchStart()` and
  `setVaultPath()` directly, so PathGuard, MCP, index, and health stay bound to the OLD
  root while the renderer (and therefore the CLI agent's per-turn cwd) follows the new
  one — a split-brain switch. Fix by routing those handlers through `workspace.open()`.
  Natural home: step 4 (dock shell touches this surface) or a standalone small fix
  before it.
- `WorkspaceService.open()` re-entrancy was flagged in the same review and is FIXED on
  main (serialized open chain, last caller wins; regression tests in the
  workspace-service suite). No action needed — noted so nobody re-litigates it.

## Open items deliberately left for later phases

Loop scheduler + per-slug budget aggregation + max-$ budget (Phase 3), LSP + git map
(Phase 4), adapter-native permission hooks (OQ1 deferral, reserved seam), worktree
isolation (only if parallel usage demands), renderer "workspace" filter-naming cleanup,
state.md knowledge-indexing, DocumentManager coordination for git discard, MCP gate
convergence onto QueueHitlGate. (Adapter registry + session-types landed as Phase 2
step 1.) The full residual lists with rationale: end of 02-phase-1-specs.md (Phase 1)
and "Deferred / accepted residuals" in 04-phase-2-specs.md (Phase 2).
